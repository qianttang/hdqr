Description: Implements an efficient algorithm for fitting the entire regularization path of quantile regression models with elastic-net penalties using a generalized coordinate descent scheme. The framework also supports SCAD and MCP penalties. It is designed for high-dimensional datasets and emphasizes numerical accuracy and computational efficiency. This package implements the algorithms proposed in Tang, Q., Zhang, Y., & Wang, B. (2022) <https://openreview.net/pdf?id=RvwMTDYTOb>.
