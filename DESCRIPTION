Description: Implements an efficient algorithm to fit and tune penalized quantile regression models using the generalized coordinate descent algorithm. Designed to handle high-dimensional datasets effectively, with emphasis on precision and computational efficiency. This package implements the algorithms proposed in Tang, Q., Zhang, Y., & Wang, B. (2022) <https://openreview.net/pdf?id=RvwMTDYTOb>.
